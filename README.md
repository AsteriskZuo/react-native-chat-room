# Introduction to ChatroomUIKit

ChatroomUIKit is designed to address most users' chat room requirements specific to pan-entertainment scenarios. It delivers good user experience in the use of APIs (for user-side developers) by streamlining the SDK integration, facilitating customization, and offering comprehensive documentation.

For iOS app:

- Xcode 13 or higher and its related dependency tool.

For the Android app:

- Android Studio 2021 or higher and its related dependency tool.

## ChatroomUIKit installation

```sh
npm install react-native-chat-room
# or
yarn add react-native-chat-room
# or
npx expo install react-native-chat-room
```

## Sample project demonstration

The sample project is located in the `example` folder. You can download the source code, compile and run the demo.
